  <h2>The Project</h2>
  <h3>Statement of the problem</h3>
  <h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We have a stream of transaction records from customers, and we want to associate them with specific entities, for example "Starbuck's" or "Amazon.com".</li>
      <li>We may or may not have access to a first-level categorization, e.g. "Coffee house" or "On-line retailer".</li>
      <li>The solution will have to scale to large volumes, and ideally would categorize the transactions as they stream in.</li>
    </ul>
  </h4>
  <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
  <h4>This problem is a version of the "record linking" or "entity resolution" problem, which is difficult to solve. In the general case, there are errors in the key used to associate the records due to human input, (typographic errors, abbreviations, etc).  In situations like medical records, matching errors have serious implications. In this case, charactistics of the records make it easier to make progress:</h4> 
  <h4><ul>
    <li>The identifying information is generated by a computer, rather than human input, so we don't expect typographic errors to be a major problem. We might expect to see abbreviations, like "Starbcks", but at least they would be consistent.</li>
    <li>The number entities we expect to match too is finite, and we expect a relatively small number to dominate.  We may be able to apply the "80-20 rule", at least as a first step. We can measure progress as we expand the universe of entities we match to.</li>
    <li>The cost of being wrong is manageable.  If we can correctly categorize a reasonable percentage of the records, and the remainder are either in an "other" bin or are occasionally mismatched, that may still be useful.</li>
  </ul></h4>
  <h4>If these hypotheses hold true, we can try to attack the "entity resolution" problem as a categorization problem, which is probably easier.</h4>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h4>I will be analyzing the data using Databricks Notebook.  Databricks is the orginal developer of Apache Spark, and they offer a verson of Spark hosted on AWS.  Seems like a natural first cut.  They have a nice notebook front end, allowing the user to work with the data interactively and do basic visualization.</h4>  
<h4>I will publish the most recent version of the notebook <a href="https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/8309242842705243/282885315782248/5947017237141061/latest.html">here</a> so you can follow my progress.</h4>
